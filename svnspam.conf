# SMTP host name                                                     (Required)
#   Specify an SMTP server to relay the mail through
#$smtp_host = "mail.example.com"


# Who should be mailed?                                              (Optional)
#
#     Multiple addresses may specified.  These will be used in addition to any
#   --to arguments given to collect_diffs.rb on the commandline
#
#     If you need lots of commit-mail recipients, consider setting up a mailing
#   list to propogate the messages.

addRecipient ""

# Additional SMTP Headers                                            (Optional)
#
#     You can specify additional headers to add to the generated email.  (For
#   instance, you could flag mails, and tell SpamAssasin to be kind to them.)

#addHeader "Reply-To", "dev-list@somewhere.invalid"
#addHeader "X-Been-There", "crackmonkey.org"


# Link to Bug/Issue Tracking systems                                 (Optional)
#
#     If you want comments to include links to a Bugzilla installation, give
#   $bugzillaURL of the page for viewing bugs (usually show_bug.cgi) using the
#   string '%s' to specify where the bugId should be substituted.
#
#     If you specify a URL, text within log-comments of the form 'bug 1234'
#   will be made into hyperlinks in the generated email.
#
#     When $jiraURL is given, text of the form 'project-1234' will be linked
#   to this issue in JIRA.

#$bugzillaURL = "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=%s"

#$jiraURL = "http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=%s"

#$rtURL = "https://noc.bitpusher.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=%s"

# Link to Wiki systems
# 
#   If you want comments to include links to a Wiki installation, give
#   $wikiURL of the wiki's page, using %s to specify where the link
#   should be substituted. Example:
#
#   $wikiURL = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s"
#
#   If you specify a URL, text within log-comments of the form '[[wiki link]]'
#   will be made into hyperlinks in the generated email.

$wikiURL = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s"

# Link to SVN web frontends                                          (Optional)
#
#     The generated mail can contain links to the new/original versions of a
#   changed file.  This can be particularly useful for viewing binary files
#   (i.e. images) before an after a change, as no diff is included for these.
#
#     Specify one of either $viewsvnURL or $svnwebURL (or neither if you don't
#   have them, and don't want links).  For ViewSVN, the URL usually ends with
#   'viewsvn.cgi'.  

#$viewsvnURL = "http://localhost/cgi-bin/viewsvn.cgi"

#$svnwebURL = "http://localhost/cgi-bin/svnweb.cgi"



# svndiff keyword ignoring                  (Default: show changes in keywords)
#
#     Changes in SVN keywords can be distracting.  For instance, the
#   $Revision: 1.12 $ keyword will change on each commit.  Set this value to true
#   to exclude changes in keyword fields (adds the -kk option to cvs diff).

#$diff_ignore_keywords = true


# $no_removed_file_diff and $no_added_file_diff
#
#     Set both these options, and emails will only include diffs for files
#   that previously existed in the repository and have been modified, but not
#   deleted...


# Don't show diff for removed files             (Default: show file's contents)
#
#     If you aren't interested in seeing the contents of a file that was
#   removed, set this option to true.  The files will still appear in the index
#   at the top of the email.

#$no_removed_file_diff = true


# Don't show diff for added files             (Default: show file's contents)
#
#     If you aren't interested in seeing the contents of a file that was
#   added, set this option to true.  The files will still appear in the index
#   at the top of the email.

#$no_added_file_diff = true


# Don't show any diffs in email                         (Default: show diffs)
#
#     In addition to the two switches above for removing diffs for newly-added
#   and just-removed files, you can use this option to simply stop any diff
#   output appearing in the email at all.  This overides the values set for
#   $no_removed_file_diff and $no_added_file_diff.

#$no_diff = true



# Email character set                       (Default: no charset specification)
#
#     Allows the specification of a character set for all generated emails.
#   The files SVN is dealing with should already be in the character set you
#   specify -- no transcoding is done.

#$charset="ISO-8859-1"



# File names in Subject                      (Default: no filenames in Subject)
#
#     Some people like file names to appear in the email subject.  To make
#   them happy, you can say $files_in_subject = true here.

$files_in_subject = true
